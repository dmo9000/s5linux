A good indicator if installCDE failed is if /usr/dt/dthelp is missing. 

Several types of documentation apparently do not yet build correctly. 

Ensure it has an awk available when running installCDE in a chroot (required because the script only has no support for DESTDIR) and 
make install with DESTDIR specified doesn't install everything. 

Apparently gawk5+ has a bug which causes warnings, using AT&T nawk can fix this. I can't be bothered packaging nawk right now.
